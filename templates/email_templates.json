Rest assured that we value our supporters & strive to provide a great customer experience which I can see we have fallen short of. We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback so that we can continue to improve.<br><br>To provide some context, our vendor's License Plate Reader system is intended to automatically scan the license plate number at entry as it approaches the pay station. It then will search through our database to find a registered match & if that vehicle is affiliated with an active membership profile, it then provides the vehicle with their club's wash, if your're at our Parkland or Margate locations it will also have the option of adding on any of our interior membership upgrades from the menu at this time.<br><br>License plate recognition usually works best with standard issue state plates since non-standard characters, spacing, or alternative graphic backgrounds/borders may at times interfere with the accuracy of these reads. Typically, attendants are able to quickly assist customers with custom plates by being near the pay station & swiping our Management Card to look up the plate manually when needed.<br><ul><li>I will be sharing your feedback with each site's management team so that we can use this as a valuable coaching opportunity regarding clear communication & having attendants nearby.</li><li>I would also like to take a look into your account to confirm that everything is registered correctly on our end. When you have a moment, <b>please reply back with the:</b><ul><li>Phone number affiliated with this membership</li><li>License plate number that should be on file</li></ul></ul><br><br>That will allow me to look into this further & submit a support ticket to our vendor so that we can try to exhaust all troubleshooting options.
